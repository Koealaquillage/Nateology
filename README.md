When you were born, there were elements outside. You were probably in a hospital room, maintained at standard temperature and humidity, but there were still there. We were born craving for the sun,
for the rain, for the wind, for the experience of life. And even if today society makes us spend more and more time separated from nature by concrete walls, we keep on feeling them. More than
feeling them; we keep on having a part of us that is them. 

The day you were born was the first contact with the outside world, and this contact marked you for the rest of your terrestrial existence. From that day, water gave you its fluidity, the sun
its power, the air its weight and will to explore and the heat your openness to the outer world. More than that, the luminosity, the clouds, the trees hormones, everything left its mark on you
for the first time. Now with the time you have evolved, grew your branches, spiritually and physically. Those roots though, have never left.

Today is the day you reconnect with those roots and start growing as the healthy strong tree you should always have been. Today is the day you reconnect with the ancient practice of Mesopotomia,
Celt druids and China that have been partially lost by the modern society.

The nateology is the art of knowing yourself by connecting with the elements, and growing accordingly. It should help you not only be yourself, but open up and be a strength for the natural world
that needs you. We lost our connection and are going to our ruin, let's take it back and be the part of the world we have always been.
